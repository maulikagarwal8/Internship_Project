##This project deals with the prediction of hills and valleys using the Logistic Regression model.

Our main objective is to use feature variables and predict the target variable.
Here our target variable(Y) is 'Class' column representing Hill/Valley by 1/0 respectuvely.
And rest of the columns are the feature variables(X).

In this data prediction we first imported all the required librarires needed, then imported required data, then we preprocessed the data according to our needs, 
then we defined Target Variable (y) and Feature Variables (X) , then splitted the data (70% for training and 30% for testing the model), 
then chose the appropriate model according to the problem in this case it was a classification problem so we chose Logistic Regression, 
then we trained our model and in last predicted the target variable(Y). 

##According to the performance of the model we achieved accuracy of 96%.
